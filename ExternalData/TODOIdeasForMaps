Great idea for analyzing map-specific performance! Looking at your `GameLogEntry.MapName` data, here are some cool visualization concepts for comparing Village vs Château performance:

## 1. **Split Performance Dashboard**
A side-by-side comparison showing key metrics for each map:

```typescript
interface MapPerformanceData {
  mapName: string;
  totalGames: number;
  winRate: number;
  avgSurvivalTime: number;
  favoriteRole: string;
  deathTypes: { [key: string]: number };
  killCount: number;
}
```

## 2. **Radar/Spider Chart Comparison**
Perfect for showing multiple performance dimensions at once:
- Win rate by camp (Villageois/Loups/Solo)
- Survival rate
- Vote accuracy
- Kill efficiency
- Role diversity

## 3. **Heat Map Matrix**
Players on Y-axis, performance metrics on X-axis, with color intensity showing Village vs Château performance difference.

## 4. **"Map Preference" Scatter Plot**
X-axis: Village performance score, Y-axis: Château performance score. Players in different quadrants show their map strengths.

## 5. **Interactive Toggle Charts**
Your existing charts with a map filter toggle - users can switch between "Village only", "Château only", or "Compare both" modes.

## Implementation Suggestions:

### Most Impactful: **Map Performance Comparison Component**
```typescript
// New computation function
function computeMapPerformanceComparison(gameData: GameLogEntry[]) {
  const mapStats = new Map<string, {
    village: PlayerMapStats,
    chateau: PlayerMapStats
  }>();
  
  // Process each game by map
  gameData.forEach(game => {
    const mapType = game.MapName.toLowerCase();
    if (!['village', 'château'].includes(mapType)) return;
    
    game.PlayerStats.forEach(player => {
      // Calculate map-specific metrics
    });
  });
  
  return Array.from(mapStats.entries()).map(([player, stats]) => ({
    player,
    ...stats,
    winRateDifference: stats.chateau.winRate - stats.village.winRate,
    preferredMap: stats.chateau.winRate > stats.village.winRate ? 'Château' : 'Village'
  }));
}
```

### Chart Ideas:
1. **Diverging Bar Chart** - Win rate difference (Village ← → Château)
2. **Dual-axis Line Chart** - Performance trends over time by map
3. **Bubble Chart** - Bubble size = total games, X/Y = map performance
4. **Split Violin Plot** - Distribution of performance metrics by map
