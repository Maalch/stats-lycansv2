Règles du jeu:

Lycans est un jeu de type "Mensonges et trahisons" en ligne, pour 8 à 15 joueurs.

Chaque journée de jeu se découpe en 3 phases: jour, nuit, puis conseil (vote).

Les joueurs sont répartis en plusieurs camps de manière aléatoire au début de la partie (ou bien un système de draft si l'option draft est selectionnée). De base, il y a des "Villageois" qui doivent enquêter et démasquer les "Loups", qui eux, doivent tuer les villageois pendant la nuit. Les joueurs Loups peuvent se transformer en Loup une fois par nuit, et revenir en forme Villageoise une fois par nuit également.
Les joueurs ne savent pas qui est Villageois et qui est Loup.

Les Villageois ont également un objectif de Récolte pour les villageois. Récolter des ressources permet de de faire monter un score de Récolte, partagé entre tous les Villageois. Si le score atteint 100% de l'objectif, la partie se termine immédiatement par une victoire Villageois.

Chaque Villageois a également une barre de "faim". De la nourriture est présente sur la carte (sous forme de ressources) et permet de remonter cette barre. Si la barre se vide, le joueur meurt et est éliminé de la partie. Courir fait diminuer plus rapidement la barre de faim.
Les Loups ont également une barre de faim, qui ne se vide pas du tout sous forme de Villageois, mais se vide lentement sous forme de Loup. Certaines actions, comme se prendre une balle de Chasseur, ou un Piège, fait descendre la barre de faim du Loup plus rapidement. Tuer un villageois remplit la barre à 100% à nouveau. Si elle atteint 0, le loup meurt et est éliminé de la partie.

La partie se termine s'il n'y a plus de Loup (victoire Villageois), si l'objectif de Récolte est atteint (victoire Villageois) ou si les Loups sont majoritaires (en cas d'égalité de nombre, par exemple 2 villageois restant et 2 loups, les loups gagnent aussi). 

Quand un joueur meurt, il passe automatiquement en mode "spectateur" où il peut voir tous les autres joueurs à sa guise.

En plus des pouvoirs et des rôles secondaires, les Loups peuvent avoir deux sous-rôles spécifiques: 
- Traître est un loup qui ne peut pas se transformer en loup, mais qui doit aider les autres loups à gagner. Il peut toutefois saboter comme un loup.
- Louveteau est un loup qui ne peut se transformer qui si au moins 1 autre loup est mort.

Il existe également des "rôle solo" qui ont leurs propres objectifs de victoire et ne sont ni avec les loups, ni avec les Villageois. Voici la liste:

**************************************************** Solo roles****************************************************

Idiot du Village: He wins if he gets voted out during a meeting or killed by the hunter (any time). He gets hungry slower but staying inactive makes him very hungry.

Cannibale: He can eat corpses (even Wolf corpses) and he wins if he eats enough of them. They give him the Full effect, and he cannot eat while Full.

Agent: If this solo role is picked, there will be two agents. They can identify each other and also identify Wolves. Each Agent can eliminate the other. He wins by being amongst the last survivors at the start or end of a meeting, provided the other Agent is dead.

Espion: He gets two targets to spy on (red names in the player list). Once he Spies on someone, he gets new targets shortly afterwards. He wins if he manages to Spy enough times, but anyone Spied upon will be warned of this at the next meeting!

Scientifique: He wins by attaining 100% Research. His Research increases by being close to a transformed Wolf, or by witnessing a Wolf kill or transformation. The more risks he takes, the faster he gains Research.

Amoureux: Actually a duo role. They win by surviving and killing most other players. One Lover is always a Villager and the other a Wolf. The Villager cannot heal naturally and only the Wolf's kills can heal him, but they can communicate directly and help each other through telepathy.

La Bête: Few things are known about the Beast. It is said that it can Mark other players and then go on a rampage...

Chasseur de Prime: He gets specific targets to eliminate, and he has a silenced rifle.

Vaudou: Réanime des corps de villageois morts pour travailler pour lui.


**************************************************** Secondary roles (given in addition to the main role) ****************************************************

    Most active powers for secondary roles have a cooldown

Howler: He can increase the range of his voice and slow down nearby people while he's talking. If he's in Wolf form, he will instead stun ALL villagers and slow them down.

Alcoholic: Negative and neutral potion effects are replaced with random positive ones. He can use his power to change a gadget (such as traps) into a potion. In addition, an Alcoholic Wolf can take and drink potions while in Wolf form to heal himself!

Detective: He can Inspect someone to know whether they've killed since the latest night (or, if he's a Wolf, to know their roles). In addition, he knows who the Hunter is.

Sprinter: He can activate Sprint at will to become faster, but this rapidly drains his hunger bar. In addition, a Sprinter Wolf can, in wolf form, Chase to get really fast for a short moment.

Infected: If he's a Villager and is killed by a Wolf, he forces that Wolf to untransform after a while (the Wolf is notified of this). If he's a Wolf, in wolf form, he can Infect nearby villagers to make them fart and find them more easily!

Teleporter: He can set up an invisible beacon, then at any time he can teleport to it after a 3 seconds delay.

Engineer: He can create a random gadget. In addition, traps have less duration on him and he disarms them faster, he breaks locks faster, and smoke bombs have a lower radius for him.

Stealther: In human form, he can become Stealthed to be invisible and have silent footsteps, but he can't run in this state. In Wolf form he instead becomes undetectable (no scary effect).

Politician: During daytime, he can cause a player to be stunned during the next meeting, unable to talk or vote. In addition, if he's a Villager and would be voted out then someone else dies instead!

Metabolic: If he's a Villager, any food he loots will heal him for more health. If he's a Wolf, he can secretly mark someone during the day to make them starve during the next night!

Illusionist: If he's a Villager, he can blind all transformed Wolves for a short time. If he's a Wolf, he can shuffle the appearence of all players!

Sherif: Using a bullet, he can attempt to kill someone... but if their target is on the Villager side, then the Sherif dies instead! In addition, a Sherif Wolf is slightly resistant to bullets and can still run for a few seconds after being hit by one.

Trickster: He can switch his target's position with a random player's. In Wolf form, this effect applies to himself instead.

Medium: He's warned everytime a player dies. If he's a Wolf, he also knows everyone's secondary role.

Astral: His action range (opening doors, looting items) is increased, including his kill and sabotage range if he's a Wolf. He can also project his mind to analyze the situation from up, like a Giant potion's effect, but this consumes health.

Ranger: He can see the footsteps left by Wolves. He can also spend a little time to look for the nearby footsteps of other players.

Scavenger: In human form, he can scavenge a player's corpse to heal a little and find an item. In Wolf form, he can devour a player's corpse to heal.

Magician: He can memorize potion / scroll effects and reuse them on his target. The cooldown depends on the effect.

Actor: He can feign death to fool Wolves or villagers.

Scribe: He can create scrolls or change their effect.

Carabineer: He has a rifle that knocks back the target and stuns or slows them. The rifle recharges automatically after a while.

**************************************************** Wolf powers ****************************************************

Necromancer: Once only, during a night, he can resurrect a targeted corpse. This player becomes a Wolf who transforms immediately, but he's mute and dies when the night ends.

Shapeshifter: He can freely choose a player and disguise himself as them. His human form is changed until the next meeting. In Wolf form he can also temporarily appear as the chosen human form.

Deceiver: If he's present, illusions of transformations will be created through the night, confusing the villagers. He also an active power that gives his target a random negative effect during the next meeting.

Tracker: He can toggle his power to know the proximity of the closest player: the redder, the closer. He's slower while tracking.

Warlock: He can curse someone to transform them into Wolf form during the night. However their actual role does not change and they cannot kill.

Possessor: He can freely choose a player and see through their eyes. Once per half-day he can also force them to use certain items.

Saboteur: He can see items (gadgets and potions) more easily, and he can secretly sabotage them while they're on the ground or held by someone. A player attempting to use a sabotaged item will have a nasty surprise!

Bomber: He can give a ticking bomb to a player. It starts ticking shortly after the day or night starts, but can be given to another player before it explodes!

Seer: He knows which sides his target is on (villagers, wolves, solo). During meetings he can try to guess a villager's job: if he succeeds the villager dies shortly afterwards, but if he fails he loses the Seer power!

Poacher: He has a rifle. Its bullets do not kill the target but place a tracker on them, making them easier to find for all transformed Wolves until the end of the game.

**************************************************** Villager powers ****************************************************

Peasant: Everytime he hears a Wolf killing someone at night while not holding any item, he gets a random defensive gadget.

Guard: If the Hunter dies, he can take the rifle from his corpse and become a Hunter. He is also warned when the Hunter's corpse is nearby.

Priest: After collecting enough loot, he can protect a target until the end of the day. The first time the target is attacked by a Wolf, they will be protected and the Wolf will be knocked down and stunned.

Exorcist: After collecting enough loot, he can mark a player in human form. If that player is a Wolf and transforms during this night, their vision will be impaired and they will get hungry faster. Alternatively, he can use his power on a transformed Wolf to blind them.

Forensics: He can scan a corpse to learn the main role (villager, wolf, cannibal...) they had.

Avenger: Once enough players are dead, he can kill a single player in human form or stun / finish off a transformed Wolf.

Barkeep: On the second day, he learns that one of the surviving players is not a Wolf (but they could be a traitor or solo role). If that player dies, he will gain the info on another player on the next day.

Survivalist: The first time a Wolf attacks him, he doesn't die immediately but is temporarily Saveable. Nearby non-transformed players are alerted with a sound and a flash, and he has an icon above him. If he isn't saved in time or if the night ends, he dies.

Guardian Angel: Once dead, and once per day, he can use his power on a spectated Villager to heal them and make their footsteps unheard by transformed Wolves.
