🧪 1. Add Automated Testing
Current state: No test suite (package.json shows no test scripts or testing libraries)

Recommendation:

Add Vitest (integrates seamlessly with Vite) for unit testing
Test critical utility functions: playerIdentification.ts, gameUtils.ts, votingStatsUtils.ts
Add component tests for key charts using React Testing Library
Example: Test player name resolution, vote accuracy calculations, death type parsing

♿ 2. Improve Accessibility (a11y)
Current state: Charts use icons without ARIA labels

Recommendations:

Add aria-label to icon-only buttons (fullscreen ⛶ button, menu icons)
Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
Add screen reader descriptions for charts
Consider adding a skip-to-content link

📦 3. Extract Shared Types to a Dedicated Module
Current state: ChartPlayerStat extended type is defined inline in multiple chart components

Recommendation: Create a centralized chart types file:

⚡ 4. Performance Optimizations
a) Memoize expensive calculations
Some chart components recalculate on every render. Consider:

b) Virtualization for large data sets
For player lists with 70+ players, consider using react-window or react-virtualized in dropdowns/lists.

c) Add loading skeleton states
Replace generic "Chargement..." with skeleton placeholders for better perceived performance.

🔧 5. Error Boundary Implementation
Current state: Error handling is per-component with if (error) return <div>Erreur: {error}</div>

Recommendation: Add React Error Boundaries for graceful failure:

📊 6. Add Data Export Features
Recommendation: Allow users to export chart data:

CSV export for statistics tables
PNG/SVG export for charts (Recharts supports this)
Share URLs already exist - add "copy to clipboard" feedback

🔍 7. Search & Filter Enhancements
Current state: Player selection and filtering work well

Recommendations:

Add global search across all statistics
Add keyboard shortcuts (e.g., / to focus search)
Remember recent searches in localStorage

📱 8. Mobile Responsiveness
Current state: min-width: 1200px in .app-container prevents mobile use

Recommendation:

Add responsive breakpoints for tablet/mobile
Consider a simplified mobile view for key statistics
Make charts horizontally scrollable on small screens

🔄 9. State Management Consolidation
Current state: Triple context system works but could be complex to maintain

Recommendations:

Consider consolidating SettingsContext and NavigationContext if they frequently interact
Document the relationship between contexts clearly
Add a state diagram to the README

📚 10. Code Documentation
Current state: Good copilot instructions, but limited JSDoc in code

Recommendation: Add JSDoc comments to:

Hook return types and parameters
Utility function edge cases
Complex calculation algorithms (voting accuracy, series detection)

🚀 11. Build & Bundle Optimizations
Recommendations:

Analyze bundle size with vite-bundle-visualizer
Lazy load Recharts sub-components if possible
Consider preloading critical data files

🛡️ 12. Add Data Validation
Current state: validate-votes.js exists but runtime validation is limited

Recommendation: Add Zod or similar for:

gameLog.json schema validation on load
Runtime type checking for API responses
Better error messages when data is malformed
