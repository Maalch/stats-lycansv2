The Vote have been added to the game json files.

I would like to do some cool statistics about the voting data.

Please notice the game rule:

- Vote only take place during the Meeting phase of the game
- A player can vote another player, or skip ("Pass√©" in the log data), or do nothing during a meeting. Voting partern are interesting to check (what players are skipping the most, what players are voting aggressively, what players are not voting at all even if they are alive at that step)
- If a player has the majority of the votes, it is eliminated from the game. The goal of the "Idiot du Village" role is to be eliminated by vote (if that's the case, he wons instantly)
the players don't know the other player camps/roles, so it's interesting to know what players are able to spot and vote for others camps (and what players are not and are voting their own mates, especially as camp Villageois)
