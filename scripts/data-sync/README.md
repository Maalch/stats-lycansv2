}
```

### Achievement Types

Currently generates **General Achievements** and **History Achievements**:

#### General Achievements (üèÜüéØ)
- **üéØ Top 10 Participations** - Most active players by game count
- **üèÜ Top 10 Win Rate (min. 10 games)** - Best win rates with minimum games
- **üåü Top 10 Win Rate Expert (min. 50 games)** - Best win rates for experienced players
- **üíÄ Top 10 Worst Win Rate (min. 10 games)** - Lowest win rates with minimum games
- **‚ò†Ô∏è Top 10 Worst Win Rate Expert (min. 50 games)** - Lowest win rates for experienced players

#### History Achievements (üèòÔ∏èüè∞)
- **üèòÔ∏è Top 10 Village** - Best win rates on Village map (min. 10 games)
- **üè∞ Top 10 Ch√¢teau** - Best win rates on Ch√¢teau map (min. 10 games)

Each achievement includes:
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `title` - Display title with emoji and rank
- `description` - Detailed description with rank and value
- `type` - "good" or "bad"
- `category` - "general" or "history" (more categories planned)
- `rank` - Position in top 10 (1-10)
- `value` - The actual metric value
- `redirectTo` - Navigation target for UI

## Integration

The achievements generation is integrated into:

1. **`npm run sync-data`** - Full data sync including achievements
2. **`npm run generate-achievements`** - Standalone achievements generation + copy to public folder
3. **GitHub Actions** - Weekly automated data sync (including achievements)

## Performance Benefits

By pre-calculating achievements server-side, we:
- Reduce client-side computation load
- Ensure consistent rankings across all users
- Enable faster page loads for the player selection interface
- Centralize achievement logic for easier maintenance and updates

## Future Enhancements

Planned achievement categories:
- **Performance** - Camp-specific win rates and specializations
- **Series** - Win/loss streaks and momentum
- **Kills** - Death statistics and elimination patterns
- **Comparison** - Head-to-head records between players

Each category will have its own processor module following the same pattern as `generalAchievements.js` and `historyAchievements.js`.
